TODO:


AFTER V2 migration
- recheck the entire code
- USE power of two textures for blocks (VERY IMPORTANT, then re clone cocos2d because I commented an assert somwhere)

GUIDELINE

OK 2: Find a good way to check if a level has been succeded
OK 2: add coredata to save levels data object but used serialization, more performant for the amount of data
OK 3: Manage unlocked levels and locked levels

4: Add the statics blocks + add the rolling weapon
5: Think about a good graphic theme for blocks
6: add the option of adding a place where the player can't draw
7: start to build real levels

8: create song for the game

TODO NEXT

- complete the star system, modify timeline layer so it shows star for each level:
    (3 stars to catch / level + one star granted when level suceeded)

- timeline layer as a singleton class and update when a level is succeded !
- manage wall collision with blocks

NOTES
- Smooth the line in "real time" (maybe every 10 poins/ need to be tested) //done need adjustment
- top time line layer:
   redo the retina arrow

DETAILS
- bug, when only one touch in bomber path
- add a max path length to avoid people playing by drawing on the screen and degrading performances
- use PVR for images instead of jpg/png
- optimize the code in gametimeline to call the replace scene quicker
- check if possibilities to optimize code in touch layer touch moved
- build the weapon layer in the constructor and not in the didFinishTransition
- override set position in bubble layer so it doesn go off screen.
